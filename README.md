# M07Assessment
Holiday Manager for M07 Assessment

This program pulls information from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ and https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/
The man file, holidayManager.py, must be run in the same directory as holidays.json to function.
Any changes that are saved are written to myHolidays.json in the same directory as the main program.
